#Sudoku
This is a Prolog program that can solve a 4x4 sudoku puzzle. (I also made one that solves 9x9 but it takes a while to complete diffcult puzzles).

#How to Use
To run the program you have to call the predicate <i>sudoku</i>. Blank spaces are called using an underscore, '_'. <br>Here's an example:

<pre>
<code>
sudoku(
	4, _, _, _,
	_, 3, _, _,
	_, _, 1, _,
	_, 1, _, 2).
</code>
</pre>
